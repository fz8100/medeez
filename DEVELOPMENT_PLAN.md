## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Database Performance:** Implement proper indexing and query optimization
- **Third-party Dependencies:** Create fallback mechanisms for all integrations  
- **Security Vulnerabilities:** Regular security audits and penetration testing
- **Scalability Issues:** Load testing and performance monitoring

### üí∞ DynamoDB Cost Optimization Guidelines

**Query Optimization:**
- Always use `ProjectionExpression` to fetch only required attributes
- Implement pagination with `Limit` parameter (max 100, default 25)
- Use `BatchGetItem` instead of multiple `GetItem` calls
- Leverage GSI sparse indexes to reduce storage costs
- Use `Query` operations instead of `Scan` whenever possible

**Data Modeling Best Practices:**
- Store related data in same partition (single-table design)
- Use composite sort keys for efficient range queries
- Implement data archiving for old records (>2 years)
- Compress large text fields (SOAP notes) before storage
- Use TTL for temporary data (magic links, sessions)

**Write Optimization:**
- Batch write operations using `BatchWriteItem`
- Use conditional writes to prevent unnecessary updates
- Implement write deduplication for idempotent operations
- Store computed values to avoid read-time calculations
- Use transactions sparingly (only for critical consistency)

**Monitoring & Alerting:**
- Set CloudWatch alarms for consumed capacity units
- Monitor hot partitions and redistribute if needed
- Track cost per doctor metric (<$10/month target)
- Implement auto-scaling policies for traffic spikes
- Regular cost analysis and optimization reviews

**Target Metrics:**
- Read capacity: <50 RCU per doctor per month
- Write capacity: <25 WCU per doctor per month  
- Storage: <2GB per doctor per year
- Total DynamoDB cost: <$8 per doctor per month

### Business Risks
- **Compliance Changes:** Stay updated with HIPAA and healthcare regulations
- **Competition:** Focus on unique value proposition and user experience
- **Customer Acquisition:** Invest in content marketing and referral programs
- **Churn Prevention:** Implement comprehensive onboarding and support
